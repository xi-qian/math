# Programs to solve math problems
1. **circle**: Arrange number 1~N as a circle. The differences between 2 neighbors should between [min, max]. For example, number = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, min=3, max=5. One of the circle is: 1 5 8 3 7 2 6 9 4 1

2. **path**: Find out all paths from one vertex to another. Each vertex only occur at most one time in one path.

3. **integer partition**: Find out the number of ways to partition positive integer N into K positive numbers. Different orders of the same numbers is considered as the same way. For example, partition(5, 2) = 2 because it only has 2 ways: (1, 4), (2, 3). Check this article for details of this problem. [整数的划分](https://www.zybuluo.com/yeats79/note/1149790)
